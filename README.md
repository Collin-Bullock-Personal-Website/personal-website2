My second pass at this!
<!-- Okay, I messed up my first try with github, so I"m gonna do a second pass -->
<!-- I think I messed up the first time by pushing different branches  -->
<!-- So this time I'm trying to push each individual page after creating it, and then pull them before moving on -->
<!-- First step, the index!  I'm also including all the photos I'll be using here. -->
<!-- Okay, that worked!  Now to do the same with the about page -->
<!-- Boom, that worked too!  Hell yeah.  Now let's do the portfolio -->
<!-- And we got a portfolio.  Time to make the CSS page so it looks acceptable and hopefully increasingly less geocities esque -->
