      <p>Collin loves to run, way more than you'd think for a big guy currently typing into a computer for a living!  He's completed a few marathons, a number of half marathons, a few triathlons, some various mud runs, and occassionally just walking around the corner and proceeding to get even sweatier than you're currently guessing.</p>

    <div id="codingRender" style="display:none">
      <p>Collin speaks the language of computers!  He's been coding since the 90s, after his mom signed him up for an HTML class at the local community college!  He's since studied computer science at University of Illinois, University of Chicago, and recently completed his front end and back end development certification from Full Stack Academy.  HTML, CSS, JS, React, Angular, Python - Collin knows it all!</p>

      <p>Collin learned to play guitar in middle school by watching videos of Billie Joe Armstrong from Green Day.  He pretty much immediately started writing his own songs, forming bands, touring the country in vans that ran poorly and smelled worse, and having a lot of fun!  He even found himself managing a School of Rock for many years.  Music remains a huge part of Collin's life.</p>
